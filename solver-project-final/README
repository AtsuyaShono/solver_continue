Solver for System-level FPGA Routing with Timing Division Multiplexing Technique

Overview
It's Solver for ICCAD 2019 problemB "System-level FPGA Routing with Timing Division Multiplexing Technique"

## Usage
command: ./cada0122
option1: inputfile path
option2: outputfile path

example
./cada0122 synopsys01.txt 01_out.txt

## Work
First, read information (FPGA, wire, connection, connection group) from input file.
Next search the route, the connection path and the TDM ratio are outputs to the output file.

## Compile
g++ -o cada0122 -std=c++11 -Ofast -march=native solver.cpp -fopenmp

## Dependency
gcc version 4.8.5~
needs fopenmp
